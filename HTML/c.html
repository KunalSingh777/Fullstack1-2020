        Cascading Style Sheets, fondly referred to as CSS, is a simply designed language intended to simplify the process of making web pages presentable.<br>
         CSS allows you to apply styles to web pages. More importantly, CSS enables you to do this independent of the HTML that makes up each web page.<br>
CSS is easy to learn and understood but it provides powerful control over the presentation of an HTML document.<br>
A CSS comprises of style rules that are interpreted by the browser and then applied to the corresponding elements in your document.<br>
A style rule set consists of a selector and declaration block.
