        Bootstrap is a free and open-source tool collection for creating responsive websites and web applications. <br>
        It is the most popular HTML, CSS, and JavaScript framework for developing responsive, mobile-first web sites. <br>
        It solves many problems which we had once, one of which is the cross-browser compatibility issue. Nowadays, the websites are perfect for all the browsers (IE, Firefox and Chrome) and for all sizes of screens (Desktop, Tablets, Phablets, and Phones).<br>
         All thanks to Bootstrap developers -Mark Otto and Jacob Thornton of Twitter, though it was later declared to be an open-source project.
